This program, Bertini 2, builds on the success of the first Bertini program, and seeks to eventually replace it entirely, as a powerful numerical engine.\r\n\r\nThe theoretical basis for the solution of polynomials with Bertini is \"homotopy continuation\", the act of \"continuing\" from one system into another through a \"homotopy\", as depicted in the below diagram.\r\n\r\n![homotopy continuation](core/doc/images/homotopycontinuation_generic_40ppi.png \"homotopy continuation\")\r\n\r\n==\r\n\r\n## Current Capabilites\r\n\r\nBertini2 currently has implemented the foundations of Numerical Algebraic Geometry.  Development is ongoing, but here's what we have so far:\r\n\r\n- C++ and Python bindings for access into any functionality.\r\n- Construction of polynomial and non-polynomial multivariate systems.\r\n- Evaluation of systems and Jacobians in double and arbitrary multiple precision.\r\n- Construction of the Total Degree start system.\r\n- Construction of homotopies (they're just systems!).\r\n- Tracking of a start point x_0, corresponding to a particular time $t_0 \\in \\mathbb{C}^n$ in a homotopy $H$, from $t_0$ to $t_1$.\r\n\r\nDevelopment is ongoing, and we want your help!\r\n\r\n==\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n\r\nThe project is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/bertiniteam/b2).\r\n\r\nPlease note that this is a long-term project, and is under active development.  If you want to help, please see [the wiki](https://github.com/bertiniteam/b2/wiki) for contact information.  We have opportinuties for all skill levels and interests.\r\n\r\nBertini 2 is Free and Open Source Software.
